# This project and the info on the website is depreciated

# TL;DR

This is my own personal website. It's my first attempt
at a react based website. It was mostly meant to be a project
to help me learn about the technology. Feel free to offer feeback
or look at the code.

Take a look at the website [here]().

## Design choice and dependencies

I used a number of resources for the desgin and creation of
this website.

| Topic | Resource |
|-------|-----------|
| CSS Theme | [aesthetic-css](https://torch2424.github.io/aesthetic-css/#elementsButton) |
| Framework | react.js |
| Email client | [email.js](https://www.emailjs.com/) |
| Linter | [standardjs](https://standardjs.com/#usage) |
| Host | |
| Package manager | [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) | 

## Who am I?

Just a junior developer...
