//A lot of the logic for this was extracted from the following:
//https://github.com/sag1v/react-elastic-carousel
//Package had too much logic for what we wanted so this is a simplified version.
//Also, we convert the class componets used to functional components that use hooks as needed.

//The lib we are reading changes the css based of the params via styled components. Is there
//a way we can do this? Do we need to? Will it help making things reactive?
